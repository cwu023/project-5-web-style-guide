# project-5-web-style-guide

For this project I learned how to organize my CSS using Sass. Using Sass features like variable, mixin, and nested CSS properties helped making my CSS more modular and easier for applying future changes. Separating my CSS into different components with partials also makes it easier to debug my CSS code.

Although at first I felt using Sass added some complexities into my normal workflow. However, I think it is a good idea to use Sass if you're working on bigger projects or planning on scaling up your projects in the future. Sass makes your CSS more efficient and easier to maintain for bigger projects.
